## Data sources

- CSV/Spreadsheets: PMS exports for tenants, units, leases, payments.
- Cloud storage: S3/Drive for documents (leases, receipts, photos).
- API: Use `/api/v1/properties`, `/api/v1/tenants`, `/api/v1/maintenance` for continuous sync.

## Automation hooks

- Webhooks: `/webhooks/workflow` for screening decisions, maintenance events, KPI exports.
- Exports: `/api/v1/financial/exports` to S3/Drive/webhook.
- Notifications: Email/SMS/webhook for tenant and vendor comms.

## Common integrations

- CRM/Helpdesk: Push decisions and tickets via webhook.
- Accounting: Send ledger updates and KPI exports to S3/Drive for ingestion by accounting tools.
- Portals: Embed CasaBoard metrics or webhook feeds for tenant/owner portals.

## Example webhook verification

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X POST https://example.com/webhooks/workflow \
  -H "X-CasaAI-Signature: sha256=abcd..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "type": "screening.decision", "status": "approved" }'
```

```python verify.py
import hmac, hashlib

def verify(sig_header, payload, secret):
    expected = "sha256=" + hmac.new(secret.encode(), payload, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(sig_header, expected)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Embedding dashboards

- Export KPIs to S3/Drive and surface via BI embeds (Tableau/Power BI/Looker).
- Use webhook streams for near-real-time dashboards in portals.
