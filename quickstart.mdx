## Prerequisites

- An email account or OAuth provider supported by CasaAI.
- Data sources: PMS export (CSV), spreadsheet, or cloud storage folder with leases, payments, and maintenance tickets.
- Optional: API key from `https://docs.casaai.dev` if you plan to call APIs or webhooks.

## Get started in six steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Create your CasaAI account">
  Go to [casaai.dev](https://casaai.dev) and choose **Sign up** (email or OAuth). Complete MFA if prompted.
  <Check>Landing in the CasaBoard home screen.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect data sources">
  Choose **Data sources** and connect:
  - Upload CSVs (PMS exports, tenant lists, payment history).
  - Link spreadsheets (Google Sheets or XLSX).
  - Connect cloud storage (Drive, S3) for documents.
  <Tip>Start with at least tenants, units, payments, and maintenance tickets.</Tip>
  <Check>Data import shows green status and record counts.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure properties and units">
  Map ingested data to properties, buildings, and units. Confirm lease associations and rent schedules.
  <Check>Properties and units display without unmapped records.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Train AI agents">
  - Pick a template (e.g., Tenant Screening, Maintenance Triage, Rent Reminder).
  - Upload historical examples and label desired outcomes.
  - Name the workflow and set routing rules (assignee, vendor pools, SLAs).
  <Check>Agent status shows “Ready”.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Run a sample workflow">
  - Tenant screening: upload a new applicant CSV or form submission.
  - Maintenance automation: submit a sample ticket with issue text and photos.
  - Rent reminder: simulate a delinquent payment event.
  <Check>See actions, notifications, and decisions in the activity log.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Review dashboards and export">
  Open CasaBoard for KPIs (occupancy, delinquency, maintenance SLAs, NOI). Export to CSV/Excel or send to BI tools.
  <Check>Export completes and file or webhook delivery succeeds.</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data import warnings">
    Ensure column headers match templates (tenant_name, unit_id, rent_amount, status). Re-upload after fixing missing fields.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent training slow">
    Reduce training set size to a representative sample, then expand. Check network and retry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhooks not firing">
    Verify the webhook URL, allow HTTPS only, and confirm the shared secret header matches your configuration.
