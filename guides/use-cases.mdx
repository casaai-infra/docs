## Overview

Use these examples to model your own automations. Each scenario includes data inputs, configuration, and the outcomes to verify.

## Small portfolio manager (tenant screening + rent reminders)

- Goal: Reduce screening time and improve on-time payments for <50 units.
- Data: Applicants CSV, rent schedules, tenant contacts.
- Steps:
  1. Connect tenant/applicant CSVs and rent schedules.
  2. Enable the Tenant Screening agent with credit/income checks.
  3. Turn on Rent Collection reminders (pre-due, due, grace).
  4. Configure webhook/email for approval notices and receipts.
- Outcome:
  - Screening decision summary per applicant.
  - Automated reminders and receipt logs.
  - Reduced delinquency and faster approvals.

## Enterprise real estate firm (fleet-wide KPIs + anomaly detection)

- Goal: Portfolio-wide visibility and alerts across hundreds of properties.
- Data: PMS exports, payment feeds, maintenance tickets, finance CSVs.
- Steps:
  1. Set up scheduled data sync (API or S3 folder) for rents, expenses, tickets.
  2. Enable Financial Reporting KPIs (NOI, occupancy, delinquency) in CasaBoard.
  3. Turn on anomaly alerts for delinquency spikes, SLA breaches, and expense outliers.
  4. Export KPIs to BI tools via webhook or scheduled CSV.
- Outcome:
  - Executive dashboard with KPIs and alerts.
  - Faster detection of anomalies and SLA breaches.
  - Data feeds ready for BI consumption.

## Property manager (maintenance requests + document parsing)

- Goal: Automate maintenance triage and keep documents structured.
- Data: Maintenance tickets (portal/email/API) with photos; leases/receipts PDFs.
- Steps:
  1. Ingest maintenance tickets via API or email forward; map unit IDs and photos.
  2. Enable Maintenance Automation agent with SLA rules and vendor pools.
  3. Configure Document Parsing for leases/receipts to extract tenant, unit, amounts.
  4. Send work orders via webhook to your ticketing/field ops tool.
- Outcome:
  - Classified and dispatched tickets with ETAs.
  - Tenant updates sent automatically.
  - Parsed documents stored as structured data for search/audit.

## Data analysts (export AI-generated insights to BI tools)

- Goal: Deliver finance and ops KPIs to BI with minimal manual prep.
- Data: Rent/expense CSVs, maintenance tickets, occupancy data.
- Steps:
  1. Enable Financial Reporting and Dashboard & Insights modules.
  2. Define KPI exports (NOI, occupancy, delinquency, SLA performance).
  3. Configure webhook or S3 export; schedule weekly/daily runs.
  4. Connect your BI tool (Power BI/Tableau/Looker) to the export location.
- Outcome:
  - Scheduled KPI datasets available to BI.
  - Consistent definitions and COA mapping.
  - Reduced manual spreadsheet prep.

## Verification checklist

- Each scenario has a passing status in CasaBoard.
- Webhooks or exports deliver without errors.
- KPIs match expected values after mapping and reconciliation.
