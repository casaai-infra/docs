## What to measure

- Efficiency: time to screen, time to dispatch, time to close tickets.
- Finance: delinquency rate, NOI variance, recovery rate, SLA cost impact.
- Experience: response times, tenant satisfaction (CSAT/NPS), vendor on-time rate.

## Where to view metrics

- CasaBoard dashboards: occupancy, delinquency, SLA, NOI.
- Activity log: workflow runs, notifications, dispatches, exports.
- Exports: `/api/v1/financial/exports` to S3/Drive/webhook for BI.

## Sample baselines and targets

- Tenant screening time: baseline 2-3 days → target < 4 hours.
- Maintenance SLA: baseline 72h → target < 24h for standard, < 4h for urgent.
- Delinquency rate: baseline X% → target X-2% after reminders.
- Manual prep for finance packets: baseline hours per week → target minutes via exports.

## Example KPI export

<RequestExample>
```json
{
  "destination": "s3",
  "bucket": "casaai-finance-exports",
  "path": "reports/noi-weekly.csv",
  "kpis": ["noi", "occupancy", "delinquency_rate", "sla_cost"],
  "schedule": "0 7 * * MON"
}
```
</RequestExample>

## Tips for proving ROI

- Log before/after metrics for at least two weeks.
- Start with one property and one workflow, then roll out.
- Track both time saved (hours) and outcomes (delinquency, SLA hit rate).
- Use activity logs to show automation volume and success/failure rates.
