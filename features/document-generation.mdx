title: "Document Generation & Parsing"
description: "AI creates and parses leases, notices, and reports using your templates and data."
---

## What it does

- Auto-fills leases, notices, and summaries from templates and property data.
- Parses uploaded PDFs to extract structured fields for tenants, units, and payments.
- Maintains version history and auditability.

## Why it matters

- Save time on repetitive document prep.
- Reduce errors and rework with consistent templates.
- Keep structured data in sync with your source of truth.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Ingest templates and docs">
  Upload templates (DOCX/PDF) and specify merge fields. Upload PDFs to parse (leases, receipts, inspections).
</Step>
<Step title="Generate outputs">
  AI fills templates with unit, tenant, and payment data; adds clauses based on rules; and produces PDFs.
</Step>
<Step title="Route and store">
  Send documents to tenants, vendors, or storage (Drive/S3). Store parsed fields for search and reporting.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration checklist

- Template fields mapped to properties, units, tenants, rent schedules, and clauses.
- Approval routing for generated documents.
- Storage destination and retention rules.
