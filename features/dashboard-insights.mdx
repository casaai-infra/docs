## What it does

- Consolidates KPIs across properties: occupancy, delinquency, SLAs, and NOI.
- Surfaces anomalies and trends using AI.
- Shows agent activity, runs, and success/failure rates.

## Why it matters

- Single source of truth for operations and finance.
- Faster decisions with live data and alerts.
- Transparency into automation performance.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Aggregate data">
  Pulls ingested data (tenants, payments, tickets, documents) and reconciled outputs from agents.
</Step>
<Step title="Compute KPIs and anomalies">
  AI computes portfolio KPIs, flags unusual trends, and highlights SLA breaches.
</Step>
<Step title="Visualize and export">
  View dashboards, download CSVs/PNGs, or send metrics to BI tools and portals.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Key dashboards

- Occupancy, renewals, and delinquency trends.
- Maintenance SLA performance and vendor throughput.
- Financial KPIs (NOI, expenses, recoveries).
- Agent performance (runs, success rate, latency).

## Tips

- Pin the KPIs that match your portfolio targets (e.g., occupancy >95%, SLA <24h).
- Enable anomaly alerts to catch delinquency spikes or vendor delays early.
