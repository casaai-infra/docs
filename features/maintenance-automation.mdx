title: "Maintenance Workflow Automation"
description: "AI triages maintenance requests, enriches tickets, and dispatches vendors with SLAs."
---

## What it does

- Classifies tickets by severity, category, and location.
- Extracts structured details (issue, unit, photos, tenant contact).
- Dispatches vendors based on rules, availability, and SLAs.
- Keeps tenants updated with status and ETAs.

## Why it matters

- Reduce manual triage time and misrouting.
- Improve SLA adherence and tenant satisfaction.
- Keep a clean audit trail across vendors and properties.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Ingest requests">
  Accept requests from portals, email, forms, or `/api/v1/maintenance`. Parse text and attachments into structured fields.
</Step>
<Step title="Classify and enrich">
  AI labels severity, category, required skills, and recommended vendor pool. Flags safety-critical issues.
</Step>
<Step title="Dispatch and notify">
  Send work orders to vendors, set SLAs, and update tenants with acknowledgements and ETAs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration checklist

- Vendor pools with skills and coverage areas.
- SLA policies by severity (e.g., emergency 4h, standard 48h).
- Notification templates for tenant updates and vendor instructions.
- Webhook or ticketing destinations for work orders.
