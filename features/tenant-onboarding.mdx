description: "Capture, verify, and score applicants with AI-driven workflows."

## What it does

- Capture applications from forms, CSV imports, or APIs.
- Verify identity, income, and documents automatically.
- Generate screening summaries and recommendations with audit trails.

## Why it matters

- Reduce manual back-and-forth with applicants.
- Standardize screening to lower risk and bias.
- Shorten decision cycles with clear, repeatable steps.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Ingest applicants">
  Accept leads from forms, CRM, CSV uploads, or `/api/v1/tenants`. Normalize names, IDs, units, and contact info.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify & score">
  AI validates IDs and income proofs, checks completeness, and assigns a screening score with rationale.
</Step>
<Step title="Decide & notify">
  Generate approval/conditional/decline summaries, send next steps, and create tasks in your CRM or ticketing system.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration checklist

- Map required fields: applicant name, contact, unit, move-in date, income docs, ID docs.
- Choose a screening template (credit, income multiple, rental history).
- Define routing: approver, SLAs, notifications, and webhook targets.
