## What it does

- Aggregates rent, expenses, and fees across properties and units.
- Generates P&L, cash flow, and custom KPI dashboards.
- Exports data to CSV, Excel, or BI tools and supports webhooks.

## Why it matters

- Eliminate manual spreadsheet consolidation.
- Give finance teams consistent, auditable numbers.
- Provide leaders live visibility into NOI, occupancy, and delinquency.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Ingest finance data">
  Import rent rolls, expenses, and fees from CSV/API. Map to chart of accounts and properties.
</Step>
<Step title="Calculate KPIs">
  AI standardizes categories, detects anomalies, and computes metrics (NOI, occupancy, delinquency, maintenance SLA cost).
</Step>
<Step title="Deliver outputs">
  View dashboards in CasaBoard or export to BI tools and spreadsheets on a schedule or via webhook.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration checklist

- Chart of accounts mapping and KPI definitions.
- Refresh cadence (hourly/daily) and data sources.
- Export destinations: email, S3, Excel/Sheets, Power BI/Tableau via webhook.
